# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Add columns to database, and DAO. Worked on fixing property/env variable weirdness.

**Thoughts:** I am working on moving my project settings into source control but had some env vars set in the cli parameters. I don't want that information in VC so I am moving it into configuration files. Keeping those things separate is touch.

### Day 2: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refactor some logic from a controller layer into a service. Fix database inserts when input is too long for the column's data type. Move client creation from factory classes into Beans and change configuration from environment variables to spring configuration file.

**Thoughts:** Refactoring is fun, tests make refactoring significantly easier. I am progressing and since I originally wrote this code I now understand that putting all my application logic in a single controller class is a bad pattern. The code is now much eaiser to read and debug.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Add columns to database, and DAO. Worked on fixing property/env variable weirdness.

**Thoughts:** I am working on moving my project settings into source control but had some env vars set in the cli parameters. I don't want that information in VC so I am moving it into configuration files. Keeping those things separate is touch.
